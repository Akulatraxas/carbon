[whisper]
# On some systems it is desirable for whisper to write synchronously.
# Set this option to True if you'd like to try this. Basically it will
# shift the onus of buffering writes from the kernel into carbon's cache.
AUTOFLUSH = False

[ceres]
# Ceres nodes can have many slices and caching the right ones can improve
# performance dramatically. Note that there are many trade-offs to tinkering
# with this, and unless you are a ceres developer you *really* should not
# mess with this. Valid values are:
#    latest - only the most recent slice is cached
#       all - all slices are cached
#      none - slice caching is disabled
DEFAULT_SLICE_CACHING_BEHAVIOR = latest

# If a Ceres node accumulates too many slices, performance can suffer.
# This can be caused by intermittently reported data. To mitigate
# slice fragmentation there is a tolerance for how much space can be
# wasted within a slice file to avoid creating a new one. That tolerance
# level is determined by MAX_SLICE_GAP, which is the number of consecutive
# null datapoints allowed in a slice file.
# If you set this very low, you will waste less of the *tiny* bit disk space
# that this feature wastes, and you will be prone to performance problems
# caused by slice fragmentation, which can be pretty severe.
# If you set this really high, you will waste a bit more disk space (each
# null datapoint wastes 8 bytes, but keep in mind your filesystem's block size).
# If you suffer slice fragmentation issues, you should increase this or
# run the ceres-maintenance defrag plugin more often.
MAX_SLICE_GAP = 80
